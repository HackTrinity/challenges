A friend of mine told me about a strange server they found. There's a program on it called `whisper` which apparently is
supposed to "whisper" a flag to the program it runs on. I tried `whisper cat -`, but nothing happened and the program
stopped pretty quickly...

You can SSH into the server with `ssh whisper@192.168.145.1`
