Turns out there were more prototype routers lying around in that bin! This one
seems to be a bit newer, and the firmware you used to get the flag out of the
other one won't work. Apparently there's some sort of verification process built
into this revision?

There was a new sample firmware on the CD, although the upgrade tool was the
same. You can find the debugger at `192.168.148.2:23` and the router (when
booted) at `192.168.148.1`.
