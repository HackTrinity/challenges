Somebody pwned our DNS a while back and set up a website on a subdomain. They've
since cleaned it out and we don't know what the website was called. We're all
about _transparency_ here at HackTrinity so we'd like to let our users know.

_Note: This flag will not be in the standard `HackTrinity{}` format_
